Crystals Collector Game

When the page loads, a random number will generate in the "Number to Get" box

The four crytals will also be assigned a random number 

The point of the game is to match "Your total score" with the "Number to Get" by clicking on the crystals which will add points to your score each time a crystal is clicked. 

The player wins the game if their total score matches the random number and the player loses the game if their total score goes above the random number.

The amount of points assigned to the crystal is unknown to the player, but can be identified once a player clicks on the crystal. 

The number of games won and lost will be displayed.

If the player successfully matches their total score to the random number they get 1 win, if the player's total score is above the random number the player get 1 loss, either way the game restarts.

When the game is restarted, the player will be shown a new random number, all the crystals will now have 4 different hidden values, and the player's total score is reset to 0.


Game design note:
The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120
Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12
